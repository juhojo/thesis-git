 abstract = {The main objective of this article is to provide a framework, based on a critical appraisal of the philosophy of science, that could help science educators to choose between domain-specific and domain-general strategies for enhancing the thinking skills of their students. Recent literature has emphasized that one of the most pervasive features of scientific practice is that of gathering evidence by making observations and conducting experiments. Research suggests that children do manifest, in a rudimentary form, the scientific thinking skills of raising causal questions, generating hypotheses and conducting experiments in order to test hypotheses, and that these skills increase progressively with age. It is concluded that we should not in the science classroom, emphasize only domain-specific knowledge. Absence of a single 'scientific method' provides the occasion to shift from one method to another, thus facilitating competing frameworks of understanding. Evidence is provided to show that emphasizing domain specific (content) over domain general knowledge is consistent with a Kuhnian perspective of 'normal science'. On the other hand, adopting the Lakatosian perspective would enable the students to understand that scientific progress goes through a process of conflicting frameworks, based on processes that require elaboration of rival hypotheses and their evaluation. It is concluded that the content-process dichotomy is misleading as the two approaches to teaching science would rather complement each other.},
